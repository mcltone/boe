Marco Cosentino Lagomarsino (MCL) is a theoretical statistical physicist. He works in the areas of quantitative biology and physics of living systems. His work can be defined as "model-guided data science", because ti combines mathematical models and moded-guided data analysis. MCL holds a PhD in Physics from the University of Leiden (2004), and a HDR (Habilitation Defense, 2011) from the University of Paris Sorbonne. Between 2000 and 2009, he worked in Amsterdam at the AMOLF institute for molecular physics, at the Curie institute in Paris, and at the University of Milan. He then joined the French CNRS in 2009 and he worked as a researcher and then as a research director at Sorbonne University, before moving to Milan in 2018. Since 2018, MCL runs a research group at the IFOM Foundation and teaches as an associate professor at the University of Milan.


<!---
MCL performed work in several areas of biological physics including chromosome dynamics and organization, single-cell division dynamics, and genome evolution.  His research is characterized by (i) a quantitative approach to fundamental questions in biology, such as cell functioning and genome organization, (ii) interdisciplinary work in direct contact with experimentalists, (iii) a full integration of data analysis and modelling (using tools and concepts from statistical and soft-matter physics), (iv) long-standing symbiotic experimental collaborations.
