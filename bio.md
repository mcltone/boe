Marco Cosentino Lagomarsino (MCL) is a theoretical statistical physicist and a specialist of modelling of biological systems. He obtained a PhD in Physics from the University of Leiden (2004), and a HDR (Habilitation Defense, 2011) from the University of Paris Sorbonne. Between 2000 and 2009, he worked in Amsterdam at the AMOLF institute for Molecular Physics, at the Curie Institute in Paris, and at the University of Milan. He then joined the French CNRS in 2009 and he worked as a researcher and then as a research director, at Sorbonne University, before moving to Milan in 2018. Since 2018, he holds a group leader position at IFOM and an Associate Professor position at the University of Milan. MCL performed work in several areas of biological physics including chromosome dynamics and organization, single-cell division dynamics, and genome evolution.  His research is characterized by (i) a quantitative approach to fundamental questions in biology, such as cell functioning and genome organization, (ii) interdisciplinary work in direct contact with experimentalists, (iii) a full integration of data analysis and modelling (using tools and concepts from statistical and soft-matter physics), (iv) long-standing symbiotic experimental collaborations.
