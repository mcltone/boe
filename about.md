Welcome to the web site of the book "Back-of-the-Envelope Climate Change"
by Marco Cosentino Lagomarsino

This book aims to give some useful tools to navigate our "era of data", with an emphasis towards reading the data with some care and proposing interpretations constructively. The hope is to convey simple techniques for interpreting the data positively, drawing interesting conclusions while being aware of possible caveats, biases and limitations. It covers some of the basic facts about climate change with the main purpose of stimulating informed critical thinking and making climate change data something we can all begin to grasp by ourselves. It is also a chronicle of my own venture into (simple) climate-change data. 

The book is was completed in Nov 2022 in a first draft form made available on this website, a complete revision was produced in Jan 2023. At the moment  **a full pdf-format eBook of the Jan 2023 draft is free to download and read**.
