Welcome to the web site of the book "Back-of-the-Envelope Climate Change"
by Marco Cosentino Lagomarsino

This book covers some of the main facts about climate change with the main purpose of stimulating informed critical thinking and making climate change data something we can all begin to grasp by ourselves. It is also a chronicle of my own venture into (simple) climate-change data. Most of all, it aims to be a book about the era of data, with an emphasis towards reading the data constructively.

The book is now in draft form and is being evaluated by a publisher. At the moment you can download a teaser including the draft of the first chapter. 

A pdf-format eBook of the draft will be free to download and read. However, please keep in mind that all the material is under copyright. You do not have the right to edit or distribute the book, copy it, print it, or post it on a web site without explicit permission from the author.
